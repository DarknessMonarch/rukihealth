Please note that additional processing time of three (3) to five (5) business days may be required by your financial institution before the refund is reflected in your account. RukiHealth is not responsible for delays caused by financial institutions.

          Refunds will be issued in the amount of the product purchase price. Refunds do not include original shipping charges, return shipping charges, or applicable transaction fees paid at the time of purchase. If you received a special promotional discount, the refund will reflect the discounted price paid, not the regular retail price. Gift cards used for purchase will be refunded as store credit.

If exchanging for an item of greater value, you will be responsible for payment of the difference. If exchanging for an item of lesser value, we will issue a refund for the difference. Exchanges will be shipped at Company expense; however, customers are responsible for return shipping costs of the original item.
